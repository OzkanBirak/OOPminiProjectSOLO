### Mini Project 4: Course Registration System

**Software Requirements:**
- Manage different forms of courses, such as lectures, seminars, and labs, each possibly having different scheduling and registration requirements.
- Handle special course types, like honors courses or remote learning options, which may involve unique enrollment criteria or administrative procedures.
- Allow multiple user roles (e.g., student, administrative staff, faculty advisor) to interact with the system, each possibly needing to perform distinct actions or having different access levels.
